Does not come with mattress or cover. Mattress and cover can be purchased separately. A Vast Icon, the Samson Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed. Crafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda. Click + Collect Click + Collect Flat Rate Delivery Flat Rate Delivery Ways to Pay Ways to Pay Key Features - Mango Timber The timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component. This piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations! Country of Origin: India Product Care - Timber Hardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below: Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth; Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately; To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months. Only use natural wax , oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer. Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents. Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur. Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.

Charlie has always gone above and beyond with great customer service! We recommend them to all our friends. Just recently we needed an adjustable bed after my mom’s injury and we needed ASAP to be able to bring her mom from the hospital. As always Charlie made it happen! Great store and great employees!!!! Caryl H. I have shopped at Wayne’s Furniture for years and always had a Great experience. Charlie is the greatest salesman and very honest about his knowledge in furniture. When something goes wrong with the furniture like the switches on the couch or chair he always sends Mike who is very Knowledgeable and fixes it instead of buying new furniture. Charlie is trustworthy and makes sure his customers are happy with the service provided. GREAT job Charlie keep up the good work!!!! Tammy B. I found there is a great reason why Wayne's Fine Furniture has been around for so long - it's their great knowledge of the furniture industry, ability to navigate the current logistical challenges, and awesome customer service that puts Wayne's above its competitors. Charlie was a true partner through the process, helping to troubleshoot when my furniture was held up in transit. I would definitely recommend Wayne's!! Susanne K. By far one of the most positive experiences you can get at a furniture store, Charlie goes above and beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied even a year after the sale was done. That’s the type of service and commitment you just see less and less of these days. Would highly recommend for your next furniture purchase! Also the prices and quality are unmatched. Nick K. My husband and I bought our very first home a couple months back so we decided to furnish our new home. We shopped and shopped until we came across this mom and pop store Wayne’s Furniture. We went in and furnished the master bedroom as well as my youngest sons room. Charlie is great! Super customer friendly savvy, fast delivery. I LOVE my bed and anyone who tours my home comments on my bed! My sons first time in his own room and he was too excited to start decorating! Thanks again Wayne’s Furniture- check them out. 5/5 stars for me Shaura H. I was first introduced to Wayne’s furniture by my brother. Who only makes recommendations if he knows the company or person is reputable. Needless to say, Charlie and his staff did not disappoint. Even, with uncontrollable delivery delays they kept us updated on every step of the way. If you want quality furniture and good service use Waynes!!! Jackie B. Give us a Call!

        "text": "Teak Teak is a close grained hardwood with a high natural oil content. This makes it hard wearing, highly resistant to rotting and almost impervious to the effects of sun, rain, frost or snow. These characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications. Only premium grade plantation-grown teak is used for the manufacture of Gloster furniture. The features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure, the absence of knots, splits or cracks and an even overall colour. INDOOR USE Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. If you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside (where it will not get wet), the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish. Any marks, stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the Gloster Buffed Teak Repair Kit. OUTDOOR USE Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. As with natural finish teak, left to age naturally outside, buffed teak will gradually change to a soft, silver-grey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away. After the first few exposures to water, you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly. As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak. We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner. Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface. Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface. Because teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish. Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off. If you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer. Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance. If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection. If you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split. To protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector. Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.) penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains. Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth."

The light you choose has a significant effect on the ambience and character of your room, and make a big difference in making it a functional and comfortable space. Creating the perfect light in a room is far from an easy task. Combine various light sources and use wall lamps, pendants, floor and table lamps to create layered lighting and make a functional light scape that adds beauty to overall design schemes. The perfect living room lighting provides an overall warming illumination while also adding a functional light for reading and a discreet soothing light for relaxation. Invite floor and table lamps into your décor for where extra light is needed and let pendants add sculptural expressions to your living room, hallway or dining room. Our collection of lamps range from sculptural eye-catching pendants, classic and timeless ceiling lamps, to playful wall lamps and table lamps with nostalgic expressions. We strive to create inviting and edifying lighting atmospheres that make you feel at home and at ease, wherever you are.

It is equally suited to a relaxed modern Los Angeles home as it is to a New York City apartment. The steel footrest is an added comfort for resting your heels.

The leather will vary in color and darken with age, like a great bag or a favorite pair of boots. The frame is made of a hard maple wood and sealed to protect the wood but keep the beauty of the wood's natural color. Made in the USA. This item is non-returnable. Excluded from shipping promotions.

Please also advise us of any parking restrictions, red routes or width restrictions ahead of the delivery. Access Checks If you are looking to buy a sofa but concerned that it might not fit through your doorway or stairwell then it's worth considering using our access check service.

Avoid using abrasive cleanser that may scratch the plastic. Use a tub/tile/sink cleaner; non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner; or a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the cleaner to the surface or on a damp sponge and rub gently. The plastic injection moulding process produces large numbers of parts of high quality with great accuracy, very quickly. Plastic material in the form of granules is melted until soft enough to be injected under pressure to fill a mould. The result is that the shape is exactly copied.

Please note, your delivery location must be accessible by semi-trailer and be clear of snow. Also, please ensure that your order will fit through your doorways and stairways to avoid restocking fees. For any shipment delays, storage and/or transfer fees may apply. Our delivery teams are unable to deliver via ferries. Customer will be responsible for coordinating with ferry transportation and fees associated. Please contact us for more details regarding ferry transportation. Furniture Inspection We work only with experienced drivers and ensure our Amish Furniture is heavily wrapped during the shipping and delivery process. We also carefully inspect each item prior to delivery. It is your responsibility to inspect the furniture upon delivery and report any damage while the delivery is taking place. QW Furniture will not be held liable for any damage to personal property, not including the furniture being delivered, that is alleged to have occurred during the delivery process.

Shipping charges are non-refundable and customers are responsible for return shipping costs. Certain items, such as gift cards, stains, and mattresses, cannot be returned. Refunds Once your return is received and inspected, you will be notified of the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, the refund will be processed to your original payment method within a certain number of days. For late or missing refunds, please contact us at sales@qualitywoods.com .

Please note that return shipping costs are non-refundable and will be deducted from your refund. Order Terms Payment & Financing: We understand that investing in hand-crafted furniture is significant. We offer the flexibility of starting your order with a deposit of just 30% of the order value. When you start your order with a 30% deposit, the remaining balance is due when your furniture is out of production. The remaining balance may be automatically charged to the card information on file. To place an order with a 30% deposit, call us at 507-289-6866 or checkout online and select '30% Deposit' under Purchase Options when you add an item to cart. Some products that ship within 8 weeks do not qualify for our deposit payment program. Build Times: Once your purchase is finalized with QW Furniture, your order goes directly into production. See individual product pages for detailed estimates of build times. Our posted build times are estimates and are not guaranteed. Remember, our furniture is handcrafted and must pass rigorous quality checks. Build time delays do not permit cancellation. Note that our build time may be extended over holidays due to our craftsmen and women taking time to be with their families. Order Changes: You can make changes to your order up to 48 hours from order placement without a fee. Changes after this time frame will incur a $100 change fee, plus any stoppage fees related to parts already ordered or cut, and hardware ordered. Cancellations: You may cancel your order up to 48 hours after placing it for a full refund. Cancellation requests after 48 hours may not be accepted, and a 30% restocking fee may apply. Shipping & Delivery: Please refer to our Shipping & Returns page for complete information. Furniture Inspection: All of our furniture is securely wrapped in blankets during shipping and delivery. It is your responsibility to inspect your furniture upon delivery to ensure there is no damage. Hand Crafted Furniture: Each piece of our furniture is handcrafted, with unique grain patterns and characteristics. No two pieces of furniture are exactly alike. We offer stain samples to visualize the finish in your home, understanding that finish colors will vary. For other product questions, please visit our FAQ Page or Contact Us . Return Requests: Given our furniture is custom-built, a 30% restocking fee applies to all returns. We accept return requests within 7 days of receiving your furniture. Shipping charges are non-refundable and you will be responsible for return shipping charges. Certain items, such as gift cards, stain, and mattresses cannot be returned. Refunds: Upon receiving and inspecting your returned item, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, a refund will be issued to your original payment method within a certain number of days.

        "text": "Facebook Pinterest Twitter The Bayswater Armchair £5,700 Ultimate comfort in a compact size, the Bayswater’s enduring appeal is testament to the wonderful design that has been popular for drawing rooms to cottages for nearly 150 years. Soft yet supportive, this is a chair for every occasion. Height: 90cm Width: 76cm Depth: 102cm Seat height: 50cm Seat depth: 58cm Seat width: 46cm Seat back height: 47cm Amount of plain fabric required: 8m The price excludes fabric.

Leg design: Tapered oak leg front, curved leg back Extra charges: Skirt: From £200 + VAT Piping or other finishing details: From £100 + VAT Price of model shown is inclusive of VAT. More information View images Facebook Pinterest Twitter Leg Finish Options How Our Armchairs Are Made We build our armchairs up from a hardwood beech frame, using traditional methods and materials. With hand-tied coil-sprung seat, arms and back. Where cushions are used, what makes them so comfortable is the high down content (50% down, 50% feather in seat, and 70% down, 30% feather in back). The down gives the cushions lovely softness, while the feathers provide loft and spring. ​ Where castors are used, they have been individually hand-cast by traditional English metal crafters to a very high standard, and a variety of finishes can be achieved. We use the antique brass finish as standard. Where legs are used, they can be either tapered or turned and come in a variety of woods and finishes (see 'Leg Options' tab for more details). We use medium oak as standard. All of our furniture can be made completely bespoke. We want this to be your perfect armchair, so if you want it a bit bigger or smaller, softer or firmer, or anything else just ask we will do our best to accommodate. The price excludes fabric. If you need some help finding the perfect fabric, let us know. Fabric quantities for standard models in plain fabric are shown in the product description. F or patterns, and bespoke sizes, get in touch and we can advise on fabric quantity.

Shipping calculated at checkout. Payment options available Afterpay PayPal or buy now from $12.46* per month. See more Also available in Our signature solid teak bench is exclusive to Living by Design in Australia, as featured on the front cover of Country Style Magazine and in House and Garden editorials. A perfect blend of modern country, meets simple nordic functionality. The clean solid lines complement the organic natural curve of the seat, ensuring no two are the same. The hardwood teak is very lightly oiled and sustainably sourced. While the wood is of superior quality, teak naturally allows for knots or slight discolouration. Our design partners hand cut and re-fill knots in the bench top according to Living by Design's specifications. Each of our teak tops vary in this process, and we do not consider these variations to be faults. An ideal bench for the narrow hallway, simple nook, or end of bed. Our extensive size range will ensure a perfect size is available. Our exclusive Sorensen Teak bench with its slender silhouette, is the ideal addition to large or small spaces... indoor or outdoor.

Give them the gift of choice with a Oak For Less® Furniture gift card. Gift cards are delivered by email and contain instructions to redeem them at checkout. Our gift cards have no additional processing fees. How soon will it ship? How quickly will I get my order? (production or lead time) At Oak For Less® furniture, we offer furniture from many different builders. Some are right here in Phoenix, AZ, while others are in California, or the midwest like Illinois or Indiana. Many of our domestic items are made-to-order and are built when the order is placed, so their production time is a little longer than others. We also offer a selection of items that are imported, so they often have quicker production times since those items are already made. Since lead times can vary, we give an estimated range. These lead times are APPROXIMATE , they are NOT EXACT . Items may arrive early or unexpected delays can occur with builders and/or shippers. These situations are beyond our control. By placing an order, the customer agrees that they understand the production time is our best estimate . When the order is ready for In-Store Pick Up or Local Delivery, you will receive a call to schedule it. Current estimated lead time is per builder item # prefix . For example, item FD-3051T has an \"FD-\" at the beginning of its item #. On our list below, FD- items have a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks. So item FD-3051T has a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks. Please remember this is an ESTIMATE and many factors can affect it. If your delivery location is outside of Arizona please add at least 2 weeks extra to these estimates to allow for the shipper's scheduling and routing delivery arrangements. Also, i f the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time. Prefix: Approximate lead time: FA / FUS * Call for current production time * FD 10 - 14 weeks HM contact us for stock availability IFD contact us for stock availability OD 6 - 8 weeks SA 12 - 16 weeks SD contact us for stock availability TM 8 - 12 weeks If you don't see the prefix of your item # here, please call us at 480-962-9930 to ask about the current production time. Need to expedite your order? We're here to help. Call 480-962-9930 and we'll let you know if it is possible to get your order sooner. A few builders offer expediting for an extra charge. Shipping information Good news! We now offer nation-wide delivery for most products (w e have shipped all over the U.S. W e do not currently have a shipper to do Alaska nor Hawaii, and do not have international shipping (sorry!). We work with different shippers and they each have their own designated delivery areas of the U.S. - some areas may not be available, so please contact us to inquire about delivery to your area. The shopping cart will automatically calculate the type of delivery depending on the item(s) and delivery location. Or, if you would like a delivery quote, please email us at info@oakforless.com or call our store at phone number 480-962-9930 and include the items that you are interested in as well as the delivery city, state, and zip code and we will get you a delivery quote. Delivery services are made by experienced independent contractors. Delivery is available if the customer is located within designated delivery areas. Delivery contractors do their best to be careful when delivering furniture, but in the event damage occurs to walls, flooring, etc., the customer will take up any issues solely with the independent contractor. Customers must have the room ready for the delivery when it is scheduled. Delivery does NOT include moving old furniture or electronic devices such as TVs or audio/video components. If you ask them to do extra work, they will charge extra. With any delivery method, the customer is responsible for making sure that the items will fit through their hallways and into the room of choice. If the driver cannot easily deliver it to the room of choice (narrow hallways/tight turns/low ceilings/is asked to move other furniture) there will be additional cost that must be paid to the delivery service at the time of the delivery. Regardless if the furniture fits into the room of choice or does not, the customer is still responsible for paying the delivery fee, it is not refundable. If the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time. Blanket Wrap delivery (states outside of Arizona) : Blanket Wrap delivery starts at $395 and goes up depending on the item(s) and delivery area. To be sure of the delivery cost for your area, please contact our store and ask for a precise delivery quote. Different blanket wrap delivery services serve different areas, so this delivery includes bringing the item(s) inside and either putting them in the first dry area (threshold delivery) or depending on the shipper for your area into the room of choice (1st floor only) - it depends on the service for your area. If your delivery requires stairs or steps or an elevator, we need to know in advance at the time of order because some shippers will not do stairs . Stairs or elevators may require an additional charge, it all depends upon which shipper it is. If you order a platform bed, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, and also includes up to 30 minutes of assembling the platform bed. If you order a table, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, but it does not include assembly of the table. If you require table assembly, please contact us at the time of order because some shippers will not do assembly. This may require an additional charge, depending on the shipper. Please note that Blanket Wrap delivery does NOT include attaching or reversing hardware or installing and arranging adjustable shelves inside of a bookcase or cabinet as this can be time consuming . It also does NOT include attaching a headboard to a customer's existing bedframe as the hole locations that need to be drilled into the headboard can vary depending on the existing bedframe .

Moo may be used for both indoor and outdoor decoration. The figuratively shaped lamp body is made of poly–resin material, that gives a smooth and transparent flow of light. The bulbs placed inside the horns add extra elements of soft, sparkling and translucent light effects to the lamp. The inspiration behind the Moo lamp was found in northern Norway, –in the breathtaking scenery of Hamarøy, where both designers have summer houses. Here the moose is frequently seen passing close to the houses and even on the lawns. The designers hope Moo will stand out as a post–modern kitch trophy, making the viewer smile happily as they recognize this “King of the Norwegian forest”.

Lovely 5 star rating Lovely Perfect! 5 star rating I needed something very specific and scoured the internet to see if it existed. I was a little leery of ordering site unseen, but the process could not have been better. From communication with the company before the purchase, the purchase process itself, the color choices to delivery, everything was smooth. And the quality of the piece itself is top notch. You all are terrific! 5 star rating We really love it! Having drawers that are custom for DVDs or CDs is fabulous! We enjoy having the lights on every evening. Thank you for making my design come to life! The quality is incomparable. We could never find anything close to this in a regular furniture store. You all are terrific! Beautiful 5 star rating Well worth the wait for something that will last a lifetime. They are very professional to work with and the quality is outstanding. Delivery was perfect and very professional. They knew just what to do to assemble this piece on site. I thank you all! Wonderful Piece! 5 star rating I just received our customized Cancun console (we had ordered it 10\" longer, 5\" of length added to each of the end cabinets) and it is spectacular! The whole console is extremely heavy and solid in the best possible way, and it just looks fantastic. We had it done in brown maple with the Kettle Black finish which is a great color with the most subtle hint of wood grain visible underneath, really nice! I can't recommend this piece enough, the entire ordering/customization process through Countryside was seamless. We love it. Well made, 5 star rating We love it.

Originally conceived by Swedish based South Korean designer Jay Design in 2012, this beautiful ethereal piece seems to defy the law of gravity. The Chieut has attracted the praise of leading architectural luminaries such as the Zaha Hadid Architects and was the recipient of the prestigious Golden A' Design Award in 2017 . The Chieut table is entirely handcrafted in Italy by design atelier Minimaproject with the finest materials in a limited edition of 200 pieces to guarantee the uniqueness of each piece. Both body and legs can be ordered in a number of powder coating colour finishes to obtain interesting cromatic combinations. Small imperfections might be present-evidence that our pieces are unique and not mass produced.

        "text": "Based in Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, Walter Cox Ltd has been a family business for 106 years. It was Walter Cox himself who started the business as a watch maker in 1918 after he'd served in the First World War, the shop was originally based in Church Street then moved to the current site on Welbeck Road in 1935. Douglas Cox took over from him followed by David Cox, Walter's sons. David and his wife, Kathleen, retired 16 years ago and now Samantha, their daughter, and her husband John, run the shop. Over the years the shop has sold many different products including paint, prams, clothes and shoes. Long before Netflix and Firesticks, you could forget about Blockbusters, Walter Cox was the place to go for all your rental videos. Through the years the shop has changed what it sells to keep up with current trends and fashions, one thing that has not changed is the pride we take in our customer service to all our existing and new customers. Today the shop sells a wide range of household furniture, beds, carpets and household electricals from leading brands such as Hotpoint, Indesit, Whirlpool, Lifestyle Floors, Dura Beds and Julian Bowen."
